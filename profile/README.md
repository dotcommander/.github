## 🔧 Philosophy & Conventions

- **dot-commands**: Enhance docs and interfaces using conventions like:
  - `.steps` – turn content into actionable sequences
  - `.bullet` – convert lists into punchy summaries
  - `.explain` – clarify code or logic like you’re teaching it
  - `.feynman`, `.timeline`, `.storycircle` — for deeper structure and creative framing

- **Design Principles**:
  - ✅ Text-first
  - ✅ Extensible CLI > GUI
  - ✅ AI as augmentation, not automation

> 💡 *Tools that work like you think. That’s the dotcommander way.*
